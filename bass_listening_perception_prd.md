| FR001         | Access Exercise                                       | As a user, I want to click on a bass listening perception exercise so I can begin practicing bass note identification.             | The system should display a clear interface element (e.g., button or link) labeled "Bass Perception Exercise" that, when clicked, loads the exercise page.                                                                                |
| FR002         | Chord Type Selection                                  | As a user, I want to select from a list of different chord types so I can practice identifying various harmonies.                  | The system should present a list (e.g., checkboxes) of chord types (e.g., triads: major, minor, augmented, diminished; seventh chords: major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, half-diminished seventh, diminished seventh, minor-major seventh, augmented seventh). The user can select one or more chord types to form their pool of possible chords. |
| FR003         | Play Chord with Random Root                           | As a user, I want to click a button to play a chord randomly chosen from my selected pool at a random root note, with the root in the bass register and the chord structure in the mid register. | The system should randomly select a chord type from the user’s pool, generate a random root note, synthesize the bass root in the low-frequency range (bass instrument) and the chord voicing with a piano sound in the mid-frequency range, and play them together. |
| FR004         | Repeat Chord Playback                                 | As a user, I want to click the play button again to hear the same chord at the same root as many times as I want, with the bass root emphasized. | Each click of the play button should replay the last-generated chord (same root and chord type) without changing the root note until the exercise is reset, and should emphasize the bass root note (e.g., slightly louder or EQ boosted) to make it easier to hear. |
| FR005         | Play Chord Without Bass Root                          | As a user, I want to click a hint button ("Play Without Bass") to hear the chord without the bass root so I can later better listen to the bass note when replaying the full chord. | The system should play only the chord voicing in the mid-frequency range (piano sound), omitting the bass root note, and label this as a hint function until the next exercise. |
| FR006         | Reveal Root Note and Chord Type                       | As a user, I want to click a button that plays and reveals the root note, while displaying the chord type that was played.        | The system should play the root note alone (bass register) and display the root name (e.g., "C") and the chord type (e.g., "Major Seventh") on screen.                                                                                 |
| FR007         | Repeat Root Reveal                                    | As a user, I want to click the reveal button multiple times to hear the root note as often as I click.                              | Each click of the reveal button should replay the same root note until the exercise is reset.                                                                                                                                           |
| FR008         | Disable “Play Without Bass” After Reveal              | As a user, I want the “Play Without Bass” button to be disabled after revealing the chord until the next exercise.                  | The “Play Without Bass” button should be disabled (grayed out or hidden) immediately after the reveal button is clicked and remain disabled until the user clicks “Next”.                                                               |
| FR009         | Next Exercise                                         | As a user, I want to click a “Next” button to start a new instance of the exercise with a fresh random root and a new chord randomly chosen from my selected pool. | The system should reset the interface: hide root/chord information, enable all buttons, randomly select a new chord type from the user’s pool, generate a new random root upon next play.                                         |
